- **Prompt engineering**: is a process of designing high-quality prompts that guide LLMs to produce accurate ouputs. This process involves *tinkering* to find the best prompt, optimizing prompt length, and eveluating a prompt's writing style and structure in relation to the task. In the context of natural language processing and LLMs, a prompt is an input provided to the model to generate a response or prediction.
