Promp Engineering is a technique for not using model but 
1. "Train" the model to "think and work" only within a limited content of data, like "selling" drinks for clients in a cafe shop.
2. "Teaching" the model new or latest information that the model might not know, making the model always have enough knowledge before answering questions.

*Note: this post I used to take note only of what I understood about Prompt engineering*
