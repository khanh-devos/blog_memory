This is my notes from a live 2-day session from Google Singapore(I think) hosted by Mr.Thu Ya Kyaw and Ms.Taehee Song:

**Summary**: Architecting for long-term success is a massive balancing act – using new generative AI functionality for productivity, while optimising your core applications for customers, and modernising existing infrastructure to keep pace. Join for an exclusive first look at the latest innovations across AI infrastructure, networking, containers, and more – all working together to help you balance performance, productivity, and cost optimisation.

1. Mr.Amin Vahdat: a Fellow and vice president of Engineering at Google, where his team is responsible for delivering industry-leading Machine Learning software and hardware that serves Alphabet, Google and the world, and Artificial Intelligence technologies that empower ML developers and solve customers’ most pressing business challenges. In the past, he was General Manager for Google's compute, storage, and network hardware and software infrastructure. Until 2019, he was the Technical Lead for the Networking organization at Google, he said:
    - Mainly about the special chips for AI computation such as TPUs and network used to connect many chips together.
    - I can see that the co-operation between Google and Nvidia in AI chips researchs.

2. Three Google Fellows shared some of their experiences:
    - Jeff Dean: Jeff Dean joined Google in 1999 and is currently Google's Chief Scientist, focusing on AI advances for Google DeepMind and Google Research. His areas of focus include machine learning and AI, and applications of AI to problems that help billions of people in societally beneficial ways.

    - Carrie Grimes Bostock: Carrie Grimes Bostock graduated from Harvard with an A.B. in Anthropology/Archeology in 1998, and an interest in quantitative methods for dealing with disparate data. She graduated from Stanford in 2003 with a PhD in Statistics after working with David Donoho on Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction problems, and has been at Google since mid-2003. Dr. Grimes Bostock spent many years leading a research and technical team in Search at Google trying to figure out what criteria make a search engine index "good," "fast," and "comprehensive" - and how to reach those goals, before working in Technical Infrastructure at Google as an Area Technical Lead for compute scheduling, deployment and e2e performance. Currently she works as a tech lead for the central ML infrastructure and tools at Google, partnering with Google Deep Mind and Google products to make innovative AI a reality in high quality and reliable products. 

    - Eric Brewer: Eric joined Google in 2011 and leads technical areas including Cloud computing and Kubernetes, and Open Source. A recent focus is security for open-source software, including supply-chain risks and helping start the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF).

3. How to optimise your infrastructure for cost-efficient AI, learn from Salesforce:
    - What is Saleforce: It is a cloud-based platform that provides tools for building and managing customer relationship management (CRM) applications. For developers, Salesforce offers a robust ecosystem to create and extend applications for businesses.
    - Mr.Niranjan Hira: As a Product Manager in our AI Infrastructure team, Hira looks out for how Google Cloud offerings can help customers and partners build more helpful AI experiences for users. He introduces about selections between GPU, TPU, CPU
    - Mr.Srinath Reddy Meadusani: Srinath is part of Salesforce AI Research Infrastructure team which is responsible for configuring and managing infrastructure to develop state-of-the-art AI/ML models. 

4. How to optimise your traditional workloads on next-generation IaaS:
    - Mr.Nirav Mehta: Nirav is a product management leader for Google Cloud Compute Engine. His domain is key pillars of infrastructure such as block storage, enterprise solutions for workloads that run on Google Cloud such as SAP, VMware, Windows, Linux, and mainframes. His team also delivers migration tooling for Google Cloud.

5. Essential Workload Security Strategies for Google Cloud:
    - **Mr.Jitendra Kumar Jain**: As a Google Cloud Technical Trainer, Jitendra has trained over 2,000 students, with very high CSAT scores. He has also been instrumental in developing and delivering new courses on Security and Network topics.
